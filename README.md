# Coursera Capstone Project - README file
The final project for the 10 Data Science Specialization involves making a Shiny app which predicts the next word in a phrase entered by the user. My app not only does that but also has the option of autocompleting a word if the user requires that instead.

The Shiny app can be found [here](https://the-roth.shinyapps.io/Course-10/).

The 5 slide presentation pitch can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/the_roth/CourseraCapstonePitch)
